Tired of wasting a quickslot on things like Assistants, the Antiquarian's Eye, or certain often-used mementos? Assign them to a keybind instead!

Questions? Comments? Donations? Hit me up in-game! @tralce, PC/NA. Hint: I really like treasure maps.

[COLOR="Red"][B]When you unlock a collectible, you must /reloadui or re-log before a bind will appear![/B][/COLOR]
